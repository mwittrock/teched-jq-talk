These are the notes and code snippets relating to a Community Talk at SAP TechEd 2023 in Bengaluru: [Handle JSON like a boss with jq](https://go2.events.sap.com/TechEd2023/agb/go/agendabuilder.sessions/?l=326&sid=121489&schid=521858&locale=en_US).

## Introduction

JSON is everywhere. Configuration, output from countless tools & APIs, and more. It's a well defined and well understood data interchange format, with a limited number of valid types and values (described in [Introducing JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)), and in particular the `object` and `array` types in combination make it easy to represent both simple and complex data structures.

Not only that, but it's supported by many systems and languages, either natively or by means of libraries.

While it's straightforward to parse JSON in a script written in the language of your choice, there's a lot of costly ceremony getting the JSON to the script.

Typically one might retrieve the JSON first and write it to a file. And then in a second step one would run the script to read in the file and parse the contents.

This is a lot of unnecessary work and the approach doesn't lend itself to typical pipeline style workflows. And if you want to adapt your script to read from STDIN (standard input), like all well behaved command line tools, actually getting your script to read from STDIN is likely to be more unwieldy than you think.

Instead, why not use a tool that is:

* dedicated to parsing and manipulating JSON
* ready to be used in a pipeline, naturally reading from STDIN and writing to STDOUT
* simple to get started with

This tool, this language, is [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/). It's described as "a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor" but in reality it's actually a full blown Turing-complete functional language with an emphasis on streams.

Not only is jq a far more appropriate tool to work with JSON in pipelines and in general, it's so pervasive that it's even built into some other tools, to provide a convenient way of controlling the output. The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) is one example (see [gh formatting](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_help_formatting) for details).

Here's an example of using the built-in jq feature in the GitHub CLI. First, this command will return a JSON value that is very large and complex (an array of objects, each one representing the intricate details of an issue, all from the specified repository):

> A "JSON value" is any value or construct that is valid JSON. This can be a simple double quoted string, a number, a boolean, the null value, or an array (` [...] `) or object (`{ ... }`) containing any of these values or constructs. So for example, all of these are valid JSON values: `"hello world"`, `42`, `true`, `null`, `[1, 2, "three"]`, `{"ID": 4711}`.

```shell
gh api repos/qmacro-org/url-notes/issues
```

Adding a jq expression via the `--jq` flag here allows us, for example, to ask for just the issue titles:

```shell
gh api repos/qmacro-org/url-notes/issues --jq '.[].title'
```

This produces:

```text

Note that gh effectively executes your jq expression in the context of what is jq's "raw output" mode, where strings are emitted without the enclosing double-quotes. In other words, raw as in "not valid JSON". This is why the strings that are produced here are not enclosed.

> The [url-notes](https://github.com/qmacro-org/url-notes) repo is where I collect my 'to-read' items, make notes on them, and [publish any such notes](https://github.com/qmacro-org/url-notes/blob/main/.github/workflows/toot-url-note.yml) when I close the issue representing the item. There's even a [feed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qmacro-org/url-notes/main/feed.xml) maintained, via a [jq script](https://github.com/qmacro-org/url-notes/blob/main/genfeed.jq).

## Using jq

Think of jq as just another command line tool in your toolbox, that can be used neatly in a pipeline, that reads from STDIN, and outputs to STDOUT. And as it does so it will, [unless you tell it otherwise](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/#invoking-jq), expect to:

* read JSON values as input
* emit JSON values as output

And when emitting such JSON values, it will, again, unless you tell it otherwise, pretty print those values, so that there's enough whitespace indentation for a human to be able to read it.

## A simple start

Let's start with some output from the Cloud Foundry CLI, cf. With this CLI you can also call [CF APIs](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/3.149.0/index.html). The responses are in JSON format. Here's an example:

```shell
cf curl /v3/info
```

The output looks something like this, not particularly readable:

```json
{"build":"v32.11.0","cli_version":{"minimum":"","recommended
":""},"custom":{},"description":"SAP BTP Cloud Foundry envir
onment","name":"cf-deployment","version":32,"links":{"self":
{"href":"https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/v3/info"},"su
pport":{"href":""}}}
```

Often the first expression used by someone new to jq is the [identity filter](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/manual/#identity), `.`, on its own. This filter takes its input ... and outputs the very same value. 

Useless? [Far from it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function), but that's a discussion from another time.

Given what we now know about how jq behaves by default, passing JSON through such a simple filter with jq has the _side effect_ of pretty printing that JSON:

```shell
cf curl /v3/info | jq '.'
```

What we see now is:

```json
{
  "build": "v32.11.0",
  "cli_version": {
    "minimum": "",
    "recommended": ""
  },
  "custom": {},
  "description": "SAP BTP Cloud Foundry environment",
  "name": "cf-deployment",
  "version": 32,
  "links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/v3/info"
    },
    "support": {
      "href": ""
    }
  }
}
```

Much better!

> The jq expression (or program code) is often supplied in single quotes as here (`cf curl /v3/info | jq '.'`). In this particular case, the single quotes could have been omitted (`cf curl /v3/info | jq .`) and indeed the identity function itself (`cf curl /v3/info | jq`), as it is what is executed if nothing is specified. But it's good practice to be explicit, and to always use single quotes.
